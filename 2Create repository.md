Create repository:
    once you need to manage your new project/existing project, you need to create a repository(not the repository you created on GitHub, it's a repo on your computer), what you use to create the repository does not meant to be a empty repository.

    In conclusion, this step is to create a repo on your computer to manage a project on your GitHub.
